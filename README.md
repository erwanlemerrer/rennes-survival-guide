<!--![Alt text](https://blog.hutong-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Survival-Guide-Sticker.jpg)-->

Welcome. Now, what would I do here in your place.
For touristic clichés, check [here](https://www.brittanytourism.com/destinations/the-10-destinations/rennes-and-brittanys-historic-gateways/rennes/). For a student angle, check [here](https://rennes.esnfrance.org/guide-de-survie-%C3%A0-rennes).

## In short

  - You can check most of the center in around 2 hours by feet I would say (so no need for bus plans).
  - To get general information you can go to the [Office du tourisme](https://www.tourisme-rennes.com/en/).
  - Central hub to get to most other places: [place République](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/48.10965/-1.67918) (check the [bus/metro](https://www.star.fr/) service)
    - Airport <-> république: bus ligne C6 (~30mn?). Otherwise taxi is ~25-30€.
    - Bus station <-> center: easy with direct metro line (stop at Saint Michel for instance).
  - Cabs are a pain to get: not numerous enough, and close to impossible to get as the night grows long.
    - to give it a try: Taxis Rennais +33299307979, Allo Taxi +33664840054, Artisans Taxis Rennes +33299360303
  - Main activity for 20-30yo: bar crawl in [rue de la soif](https://www.tourisme-rennes.com/en/discover-rennes/history-rennes/drinkers-alley-rennes/).
  - Was kind of iconic for rock in the 90s, but that's mostly passed. Techno on the rise!
  - Not really "no go zones" in the center, maybe avoid bar closing around 1am in the very center...
  - Its a hub to get to Saint Malo, that a must see (40mn by car or 55mn by [TER](https://www.sncf-connect.com/train/horaires/rennes/saint-malo) (train)).
  - If you have several days here, consider visiting [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes) ~1 hour away, its quite nice also.

## Where have you landed

Rennes capital of [Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany) (along with [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes), which French authorities are nicely trying to hide historically).
Brittany still has a strong celtic culture (Breton language, music, art), but this is not in Rennes that it will be the easiest to get in touch with (except if you're lucky enough to be here for the Yaouank festival). Except during the summer months, city center is packed with students.

## Nodal points of the city
  - Place de la république, where central metro arrives, buses. Good to go the 1) trainstation from there by metro, and 2) to the airport by cheap bus C6.
  - If you just have 1h to for siteseeing, directly go to place [Saint Anne](https://osm.org/go/eri08~5~a) (metro stop Saint Anne, from trainstation and république).

## What to bring back from here
  - Not wine. Producing region is far south, except for some Nantes region one, named Muscadet. 
      - Great replacement: honey wine, aka chouchenn, is a must (personal favorite one: [Dragon Rouge](https://dragonrouge.bzh)).
  - Quite some local breweries, so you'll have the [choice](https://www.bieresbretonnes.fr/brasseries/).

## Dead sundays
  - Most of restaurants, bars and nearly all shops are closed on sunday/monday. Crêperie on sundays: La ville d'ys, beers: La cité d'ys (yes that's a lot of [Ys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys)!).
  - The "[central hall](https://metropole.rennes.fr/organisme/la-criee-halle-centrale-659)" is open up to 2:00pm for emergency, yet on the high price.
  - Parcs (Thabor, Oberhtur, Gayeuilles...) are opened on sundays, as well as some pools, les Champs Libres, and cinemas.
  - City [site](https://dimanche.rennes.fr/) dedicated to doom sundays.

## Must see

### Music
  - Indie concerts @ [Uzine](https://uzine.bar/), le [Marquis de Sade](https://www.facebook.com/Le-Marquis-de-Sade-158854437480238/), [Alex Tavern](https://www.facebook.com/alexstavernrennes/) or [le Ty Anna](https://www.facebook.com/tyannarennes/).
  - "Discothèques"/clubs are the level of those in France: you dance on records; so do not wait for Berlin style venues.
  - For "real" clubbing, best is arguably the [1988](https://www.1988liveclub.com/), if a DJ is scheduled. Sometimes at [Ubu](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/UbuClubRennes/) as well.
  - Cool jazzy meetups at the Penny Lane.
  - Breton/traditional sessions frequently at the [Mod Koz](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/sessionmodkoz/).
  - Electro/techno DJs on thursday/fridays at [Uzine](https://uzine.bar/).
  - Irish sessions listed [here](https://thesession.org).

### Bars/Pubs
  - Best for late drinks: the [Churh](https://www.facebook.com/pollen.rennes) (for very late drinks: the Corner Shelter, and Ty Coz vor very very late drinks)
  - Best happy hour with local drafts / best dive bar: la cité d'ys (7pm to 8pm).
  - Fancy cocktails: Le Monfort, le Peacock
  - Beer place for beer geeks: la maison à bières craft.
  - Must do a crawl in rue Saint Michel at least once, not to late (<11pm) if you want a bit of space... 
  - Open space bar with concerts: [le Mem](https://www.lemem.fr/) (not in the very center though).
  - Large hipster bars outside the city: Avec, Morex Custom, BDS.
  - Bar + climbing? Check Origin.

### Food
  - Local classic fast food: a "galette saucisse", that is basically a sausage wrapped in the local pancake variant (best buy at the market on sat mornings)
  - Loads of créperies: same pancakes idea, must try, with Breton cider or sauer milk.
  - City is good for fish restaurants. Classic one is Taverne de la marine. Good one is Les pêcheurs (close to gare), for grill in the chimney: l'os ou l'arête.
  - Crash plan for eating (restaurants close early here ~23h max!): quite some choices place Rallier du Baty, rue de Saint Malo, or rue Saint Georges.

### Local shopping
  - Rennes has an historical market (17th century!) on the saturday morning, which is generally impressive for newcomers (freshest fish!).
  - Good/cheap/complete bakerie, including local specialties: le [fournil Vasselot](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurant_Review-g187103-d8605434-Reviews-Le_Fournil_Vasselot-Rennes_Ille_et_Vilaine_Brittany.html).
  - Buy a Breton flag as a souvenir, in a nice [alternative shop](https://disuj.bigcartel.com/).
  - If you want to access mass shopping with standard prices, take bus C4 (eg, from République) to Longchamps, there is a large supermarket (Intermarché)

### Various

  - General purpose museum, library and events occasionnaly: [les champs libres](https://www.leschampslibres.fr/).
